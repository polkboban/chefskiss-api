Based on your available ingredients, I would recommend making a Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken dish. Here’s the recipe:

Ingredients:
	•	4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
	•	Salt and pepper to taste
	•	2 tablespoons olive oil
	•	4 cloves garlic, minced
	•	1 cup heavy cream
	•	1/2 cup chicken broth
	•	1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
	•	1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
	•	1 cup fresh spinach (optional)
	•	1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (optional)
	•	Fresh parsley for garnish

Instructions:
	1.	Season the Chicken: Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.
	2.	Cook the Chicken: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.
	3.	Sauté Garlic: In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
	4.	Make the Sauce: Add the heavy cream, chicken broth, and Italian seasoning to the skillet. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a simmer.
	5.	Add Parmesan: Stir in the Parmesan cheese and let it melt into the sauce. Continue to simmer for about 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
	6.	Optional Add-ins: If using, add the fresh spinach and sun-dried tomatoes to the sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the spinach is wilted.
	7.	Combine with Chicken: Return the chicken breasts to the skillet, spooning the sauce over them. Let everything simmer together for a couple of minutes until the chicken is heated through.
	8.	Serve: Garnish with fresh parsley and serve the chicken with the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce over pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes.
Enjoy!
